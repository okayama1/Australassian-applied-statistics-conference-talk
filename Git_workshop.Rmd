# Reproducible research and replicability

<br><br>
**Definitions by the USA National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine**:

<br>
- .green[**Reproducibility**] ("computational reproducibility") means obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis. 

- .green[**Replicability**] means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.

<!-- # Reproducible research -->

<!-- * Working to make your research reproducible does require extra upfront effort. -->

<!-- * Making a project reproducible from the start encourages you to use better -->
<!-- work habits. -->

<!-- * It should push you to bring your data and source code up to a higher -->
<!-- level of quality than you might if you “thought ‘no one was looking’ ” [Donoho, -->
<!-- 2010, 386].  -->

<!-- * Reproducible research needs to be stored so that other researchers can actually access the data and source code.  -->

<!-- * Changes are easier to implement $\rightarrow$ specially when using dynamic reproducible documents. -->

<!-- * Reproducible research has higher impact. -->

# Literate programming

.content-box-neutral[
Literate programming is an approach to writing reports using software that weaves together the source code and text at the time of creation.

<br>

.blue[Donald Knuth coined the term
literate programming in the 1970s to refer to a source file
that could be both run by a computer and “woven” with a
formatted presentation document [Knuth, 1992].]

General practical tips for reproducible workflows

<br>
.orange[There is no one-size-fits-all approach!]



---
class: transition
# Tip 1: Plan in adavance

<br>

- Plan the type and scale of the project for reproducibility (as much as possible!).
- Brainstorm about how  different components are to be connected in a reproducible way. Update when necessary.
- .purple[.bold[Think about your "future self" and others.]]
- Set up a version control system.
- Plan for literate programming and scripting as much as possible.
- Keep revising and updating the plans as you go.

---
# Workflow organization 


Decide how you are going to organize your project's workflow and prepare the scaffolding for that.

<br>

- For example, think about the project folder's structure
- In particular, where is the data going to be stored and how?
- Where will you place the scripts and codes? 
- How are other things going to be stored in the project?
- How are the different elements going to be linked together?
- Where will you place the project documentation?

# Version control

<br>
- .content-box-soft[Version control systems are a category of software tools that 
help store and manage changes to source code (projects) over time.]
- .content-box-soft[Version control software keeps track of every modification
to the source code in a special kind of database.]
- .content-box-soft[If a mistake is made, you can turn back to previous versions 
and compare the code to fix the problem while minimizing disruption.]
- .content-box-soft[It is easy to manage multiple versions of a project
]
- .content-box-soft[It is a very useful (actually essential!) tool for 
collaborating and for sharing open source resources.]

"Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source 
code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among 
programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its 
goals include speed, data integrity,  and support for distributed, non-linear workflows"

# Absolute and Relative Paths

<br>

* .green[**An absolute or full path**] contains the computer root's directory and all other sub directories where a file is located.

  .purple["C:\documents\example\file.txt"]

* .green[**Relative path**]  refers to a location that is .green[relative to a current directory] (or folder).

# Data handling 

<br><br>


- Record the **provenance** and licensing of the data.
- Use raw data and keep data files as **read-only** whenever possible.
- Integrate all the data preparation and data wrangling in the project to ensure reproducibility:

<br>
.content-box-soft[
     * In some projects data wrangling might be done using different software.
     * When different software is used (SQL/SAS/Excel/Python)  all the steps and how they connect must be documented.
]

# Tip 4: Documentation

<br>

- Document for reproducibility from day 0.
- Describe all the elements of the project. 
- Keep a journal for manual steps.
- Be specific about documenting how different components are linked together to ensured reproducibility.
- Data provenance, licensing, scripts,  any tools used in the project.
- Clean up when necessary!

"A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers – images become containers when they run on Docker Engine."
